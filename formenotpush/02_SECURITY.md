# Security Documentation

Generated date: 2026-04-01
Scope: current controls + practical hardening roadmap

## 1. Security Posture Summary

Current posture: baseline controls exist (authentication, authorization, validation), but hardening and operational security controls are incomplete.

## 2. Existing Security Controls

Authentication and identity:

- Keycloak-based identity integration
- JWT validation in backend
- Role-based access model with route guards and role decorators

Authorization:

- Guard-based route protection in backend
- Role checks for privileged endpoints
- Public endpoint marker for auth bootstrap endpoints

Data and input handling:

- DTO-driven validation using NestJS/class-validator
- Mongo schema constraints for structural consistency

Credential handling:

- Environment-variable-based config (.env/.env.example pattern)
- Password hashing with bcrypt in data model

Auditability:

- Created/modified/performed metadata fields in multiple entities
- Timestamped records for traceability

## 3. Observed Security Gaps

High risk:

- Secrets/API key exposure risk in tracked env files.
- No clearly enforced rate limiting at API edge.

Medium risk:

- CORS and environment policy may be too permissive or inconsistent across environments.
- Missing explicit TLS/security header enforcement documentation.
- Token persistence in localStorage increases XSS impact surface.
- Potential mock fallback data path in frontend QC services.

Operational/security governance gaps:

- No single SECURITY.md as canonical baseline for teams.
- No documented key rotation and secret revocation process.
- No clearly documented log redaction/PII policy.

## 4. Priority Hardening Plan

P0 (immediate):

1. Rotate all exposed secrets/keys and purge from tracked files.
2. Move sensitive values to secure secret storage in runtime platform.
3. Enforce strict env separation for development vs production.
4. Add API rate limiting for auth and high-frequency endpoints.

P1 (short term):

1. Enforce strict CORS allowlist by environment.
2. Add HTTP security headers in backend/reverse proxy.
3. Add centralized auth failure reporting.
4. Remove or gate any mock fallback logic from production builds.

P2 (medium term):

1. Implement threat model and abuse-case checklist for critical workflows.
2. Standardize audit log schema and retention policy.
3. Add dependency vulnerability scanning and CI policy gates.

## 5. Minimum Security Baseline (Recommended)

Identity and access:

- Deny-by-default route protection
- Role + object-level authorization checks for resource endpoints

Transport and headers:

- HTTPS-only in non-local environments
- CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy

Input and output:

- Strict validation for all request inputs
- Bounded payload size
- Structured error responses without internal leakage

Secrets and supply chain:

- No hardcoded secrets in repository
- Lock files committed, dependency scan in CI
- Pinned versions for runtime images

Observability:

- Security event logging for auth failures and access denials
- Alerting and retention policy documented and enforced

## 6. Suggested Deliverables Next

1. Create canonical security baseline doc at source-code root.
2. Add secure configuration checklist to deployment guide.
3. Add automated checks in CI for secrets and dependency vulnerabilities.
